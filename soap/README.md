#### SOAP Samples

This directory contains samples of API proxies for SOAP. Not everyone uses SOAP
these days but these samples will show how to use it productively with
Apigee.

There is one sample here so far:

* simple: Shows how to create a "pass through proxy" for a SOAP web service
that also returns a WSDL with the correct URI.

All of these samples use the Forecast SOAP service from the US National
Weather Service.
