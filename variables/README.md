# Variables

This sample demonstrates how you can use the ExtractVariables policy to 
populate variables. The sample ExtractVariables policy sets the variable values
as HTTP headers in the response.

The sample policy demonstrates how to populate variable from the context, 
API proxy configuration, request message, and m by parsing message content.

The sample converts the XML response to from Yahoo! weather to demonstrate 
how to configure the ExtractVariables policy with XPath and JSONPath
to work with message content.

You can also refer to the API Platform variables reference:
