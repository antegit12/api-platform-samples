# Target Re-route Sample

This sample demonstrates a simple scenario of changing the target endpoint
with the help of setting the flow variable "target.url" in a Javascript Step Policy,
with removal of the proxy.pathsuffix. The proxy uses the Yahoo Weather API for actual
target endpoint This reference helps in understanding the process of building,
deploying, activating and accessing this sample.

The actual target api: `http://my-dummy-old-target.com/to-be-replaced`
New target api that overrides the actual target: `http://weather.yahooapis.com/forecastrss?w={object-in-request}`

Proxy Request: `http://$org-$env.apigee.net/yahoo/objects/12797282` 
where `/yahoo` is the base-path, `/objects/12797282` is the proxy.pathsuffix.

This Proxy Request will be transformed into `http://weather.yahooapis.com/forecastrss?w=12797282`
