# API Pagination

This sample shows how to perform a simple "Pagination of data" using javascript policy. 

It caches the offset and limit based on user_id header and based on that it paginates.
 
It uses these policies:

CacheLimit.xml -  It caches the Limit value
CacheOffset.xml - It caches the offset value
CacheResponse.xml - Response Cache
ContentListings.xml - Policy that mocks up 100 book entries
GetPaginationParams.xml  - This policy extracts query parameters.
LookupLimit.xml - Looks up the cache to get the cached Limit
LookupOffset.xml - This looks up the offset value
Pagination.xml - This is the javascript policy to paginate the data.


#Explaination
You have to set two headers:

user_id : this is used to store the pagination configuration(offset and limit) into cache by user_id.
bypass-cache: TRUE value means ignore cache, FALSE value means lookup for a response in cache. This value is affecting just the response cache policy.

Ex:

request.header.user_id = tester1
request.header.bypass-cache = true

Once you set the pagination configuration by user_id, the queryparams are not needed anymore, however you must provide a user_id to retrieve the pagination configuration and the next page. Once you reach the last page, the next request will retrieve the first page.


Complete example:

First request (first page and pagination configuration):
curl -H "user_id: tester1" -H "bypass-cache: true"  http://${host}/v1/demo/content-listing?offset=0&limit=10

This will return the first 10 entries. 

Second and further requests (next page or first page after you reach the last page):

curl -H "user_id: tester1" -H "bypass-cache: false" http://${host}/v1/demo/content-listing

This will return the next 10 entries. 

You can start over the pagination process by providing new pagination configuration (offset and limit queryparams).
